## Contributing Workflow

### 1. Open an Issue

```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification if applicable:

```

### 4. Push Your Branch

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```

### 5. Create a Pull Request

Go to the original repository and create a pull request. Provide a detailed description of your changes and reference any relevant issues.

## Style Guide

- **JavaScript**: Variable and function names should be in camelCase. The code should follow ES6 standards, and module files should be saved with a `.mjs` extension.
- **CSS**: Use classes to style elements, avoiding inline styles whenever possible.
- **HTML**: Use semantic elements to structure your documents (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).

If the project uses a specific formatter (e.g., Prettier), include setup instructions here.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/your-username/your-nodejs-project/issues). Include as much detail as possible:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected and actual behavior
- Relevant screenshots/logs
